I am currently a Senior Research Fellow (equivalent to Research Assistant Professor, open-term appointment) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems, Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), where I work on deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, and their applications.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at SUSTech, under the Mathematics postdoctoral station. I received my Ph.D. from the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, and my bachelor’s degree from the School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology.
